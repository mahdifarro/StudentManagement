# StudentManagement
wpf app for managing students
It's a managing app for schools..admin can add,edit,and delete student and other managers and have a file as a database and a word file output in bin/debug/List and stores user images in bin/debug/Images
I'm new in C# learning so I really appreciate if you help me to make this a better app :)
